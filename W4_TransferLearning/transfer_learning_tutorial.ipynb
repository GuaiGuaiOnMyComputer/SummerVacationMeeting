        "\n",
        "A ```resnet18``` is a pretrained deep feed forward neural network with 17 convolution layers and 1 fully connected layer. According to [this thesis](ResnetRef.pdf), introducing feed forward shortcuts to a deeply stacked network can further increase the accuracy of the model. Such feed forward shortcuts can counter the problem with gradient vanishing by adding the input of the layer block to its output. A layer block is a pair of convolution layers in different sizes. During training, if the convolution layers in the layer block is not helpful, its weights can be lowered and thus the output of the layer block can be more dependent to its input, essentially bypassing the convolution layers within.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original ```Resnet18``` is designed to classify 1000 different labels, therefor its final layer is a fully connected layer taking in the features from the previous convolution layer and outputs 1000 scores for each label. The fully connected layer can be modified to different sizes to output different number of classes."
